To install the required packages in your project, you can use the npm command in your terminal or command prompt. Here's the command to install the packages you mentioned:

```
npm install react-router-dom reactstrap bootstrap remixicon react-slick slick-carousel
```

This command will install the following packages:

- `react-router-dom`: React Router DOM is a library that provides routing capabilities for React applications.
- `reactstrap`: Reactstrap is a library that provides Bootstrap components for React applications.
- `bootstrap`: Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- `remixicon`: Remixicon is a set of open-source icon libraries that you can use in your React application.
- `react-slick` and `slick-carousel`: React Slick is a carousel component for React applications.

After running the command, npm will download and install the packages into your project's `node_modules` directory. Make sure you have a package.json file in your project's root directory that lists these packages as dependencies. If you don't have one, you can create it by running `npm init` and following the prompts.

Once the installation is complete, you can import and use the installed packages in your React components as needed.
